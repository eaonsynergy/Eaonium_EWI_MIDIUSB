# Eolium_EWI_MIDIUSB
Eolium is an Open Source Electronic Wind MIDI USB Instrument I wanted to provide to let more people have fun making computer assisted music.

The hardware is centered on a Arduino board and the case can be 3D printed.

The software part uses MIDI USB Lib, so the Arduino board must be atmega32u4 ARM based.

# Case designs
I created two designs
   1) Trompet like design : provides 10 buttons, this design was my first one with the idea to have something looking cool. I still need to improve the ergonomy but I really love the feeling playing it.
   2) Flute like design : provides 12 buttons, espacially design to be capacitive touch. I made this design to provide a case most people will be able to build with no specific tools or experience. All you will need is a hot glue gun to stick the Arduino and Adafruit boards, then slide and clip the case.

# Mecanical or Capacitive Touch
Two models are available :
   1) With mecanical buttons
   2) With Capative buttons thanks to an Adafruit MPR121 12-channel Capacitive touch sensor
