# Eolium_EWI_MIDIUSB
Eolium is an Open Source Electronic Wind MIDI USB Instrument I wanted to provide to let more people have fun making computer assisted music.

The hardware is centered on a Arduino board and the case can be 3D printed.

The software part uses MIDI USB Lib, so the Arduino board must be atmega32u4 ARM based.

# Mecanical or Capacitive Touch
Two models are available :
   1) With mecanical buttons
   2) With Capative buttons thanks to an Adafruit MPR121 12-channel Capacitive touch sensor
